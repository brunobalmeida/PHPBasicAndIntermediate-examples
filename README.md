# PHP Basic and Intermediate Examples
PHP Basic and Intermediate Examples

This is a sample repository, loaded with few basic and intermediate javascript and PHP examples that may be useful for beginning coders.

To run the PHP codes you will need to run a local server, if you just try to open on the browser like HTML, it will not work. 

I recommend XAMPP software. It is free and useful for testing purposes. 

The link to download it is:

There are a couple others servers that you can use feel free to choose any of them. 


Example 1 - PHP variable pass

Example 2 - eCommerce

Example 3 - Database connection
